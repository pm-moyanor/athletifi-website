# AthletiFi Website

This is the repository for the AthletiFi platform. AthletiFi is a sports technology company focused on transforming youth soccer development and analytics. To that aim we have created a comprehensive platform that offers in-depth analytics and valuable features tailored to the needs of the youth soccer community.

## Architecture Overview

The AthletiFi Dashboard is built using the following architecture:

- **Frontend**: Next.js framework with Tailwind CSS for UI development
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway for serverless API endpoints
- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Authentication**: AWS Amplify and Cognito for user authentication and authorization
- **CMS**: Strapi for content management

The frontend communicates with the backend API endpoints to fetch and update data from the PostgreSQL database. AWS Amplify and Cognito handle user authentication and secure access to protected routes and resources. Strapi is used as the headless CMS for managing content.

## Key Technologies

The AthletiFi project utilizes the following key technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple client-side routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service for running backend code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Fully managed service for creating, publishing, and securing APIs at any scale.
- **AWS RDS PostgreSQL**: Managed relational database service for storing structured data.
- **AWS Amplify**: Development platform for building secure and scalable mobile and web applications.
- **AWS Cognito**: User authentication and authorization service.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Jotai**: A primitive and flexible state management library for React.
- **Recharts**: A composable charting library built on React components.
- **Strapi**: A next-gen headless CMS for content-rich experiences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   yarn dev
   ```

### Strapi CMS Setup

1. Strapi is a next-gen headless CMS that allows for content-rich experiences.
2. Create a new Strapi app:

   ```bash
   yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn run development
   ```

## Amplify Setup

To set up AWS Amplify for the AthletiFi project, follow these steps:

1. Install the AWS Amplify CLI globally:

   ```bash
   yarn global add @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

2. Configure Amplify by running the following command:

   ```bash
   amplify configure
   ```

   This will open the AWS Management Console in your web browser.

3. If prompted, click on "Open AWS Console" and sign in to your AWS account. If you don't have an account, you can create a new one.

4. In the Amplify CLI, press Enter to continue.

5. Specify the AWS Region for the Amplify project (e.g., `us-east-2`).

6. Provide the access key ID and secret access key for your AWS IAM user. These credentials can be found in the provided CSV file. Be careful not to share or expose these sensitive credentials.

7. Choose a profile name for the Amplify configuration (e.g., `default`).

8. After the configuration is complete, run the following command to pull the existing Amplify project:

   ```bash
   amplify pull
   ```

9. When prompted, select the following options:
   - Choose the AWS profile: `default`
   - Choose the Amplify environment: `athletifi-website`
   - Confirm the project setup
   - Select code generation language: `javascript`
   - Select framework: `react`
   - Use the default `src` directory path
   - Set the distribution directory path to `.next`
   - Use `yarn` as the package manager
   - Set the build command to `yarn build`
   - Set the start command to `yarn start`

10. After the Amplify project is pulled successfully, you can start the development server using:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

If you encounter any issues during the build process, make sure to run `yarn install` to install any missing dependencies.

Note: The `amplify serve` command can be used to start the application using the Amplify server, but it requires a production build to be available in the `.next` directory. If you want to use `amplify serve`, make sure to run `yarn build` first.

For more information on AWS Amplify and its setup process, refer to the official Amplify documentation: [AWS Amplify Docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/)

## ESLint and Prettier Setup for VS Code

For maintaining consistent code quality and formatting, we use `eslint-config-next` along with `prettier` for code formatting. In order for this setup to work seamlessly in VS Code, some additional setup is required.

### Configuration Steps

Assuming you have already run `yarn install` which installs all the dependencies listed in `package.json`, including ESLint and Prettier configurations, follow these steps to configure your VS Code:

1. Please install the following extensions in VS Code:

   1. ESLint (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)
   2. Prettier - Code formatter (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)

2. To automatically format and lint your code on save, add the following settings to your `settings.json` file in VS Code:

   ```json
   {
     "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
       "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
     },
     "editor.formatOnSave": true,
     "[javascript]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
     },
     "[javascriptreact]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
     },
     "[typescript]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
     },
     "[typescriptreact]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
     }
   }
   ```
