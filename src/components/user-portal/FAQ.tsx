    question: `What is the AthletiFi Dashboard, and who is it for?`,
    answer: `The AthletiFi Dashboard is a digital platform that offers in-depth analytics on young soccer players' performance. It's made for players, their families and friends, and anyone who loves soccer to easily check out how players are doing on the field, with highlights of their best moments and detailed looks at their skills and progress over time. AthletiFi aims to make complex soccer data more accessible and engaging for everyone, bridging the gap between the technicalities of sports performance analytics and everyday soccer fans`,
  },
  {
    question: `How do I gain access to a player's dashboard using the player card?`,
    answer: `To access a player's dashboard, simply scan the QR code found on their digital or physical player card. Once scanned, the QR code will automatically bring you to a comprehensive digital dashboard showcasing detailed player statistics, performance trends, video highlights, and soon even live game streams. `,
  },
  {
    question: `How are the player statistics on the dashboard calculated?`,
    answer: `AthletiFi's dashboard player statistics are meticulously calculated through an in-house process that harnesses advanced algorithms that analyze game footage and performance data. These algorithms focus on key performance indicators such as goals, assists, pass accuracy, and others which offer insights into a player's skills and potential for development. These algorithms also track trends in performance over time to ensure accurate and meaningful insights into each player's abilities and progress. For example, if a player's goal-scoring rate increases significantly during the latter part of the season, the algorithm highlights this as a positive trend. Conversely, if there's a notable drop in defensive contributions, it flags this area for potential improvement. This temporal analysis is crucial for understanding how a player develops and adapts throughout the season.`,
